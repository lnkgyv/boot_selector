# boot_selector
The project is under development.
It's only showing menu in Ncurses style works.
Main menu is formed by 'boot_selector.cfg'.
There are many typos and errors present in project.
Autoreconf or other similar tools aren't used.
I write this project under OS X High Sierra with libraries from Brew,
so paths for libraries and headers may vary. Therefore it's need
to changed by yourself.
I will fix all issues as soon as possible.
